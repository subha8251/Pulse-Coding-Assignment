### Command Line Arguments

| Argument | Description | Required | Default |
|----------|-------------|----------|---------|
| --company | Company name to scrape reviews for | Yes | - |
| --start-date | Start date (YYYY-MM-DD) | Yes | - |
| --end-date | End date (YYYY-MM-DD) | Yes | - |

## Sample Output

The scraper generates a JSON file with reviews. Here are sample outputs from different sources:

### G2 Review Sample
```json
[
  {
    "title": "Excellent Salesforce experience",
    "description": "We've been using Salesforce for over a year and it has significantly improved our productivity. The interface is intuitive and the features are comprehensive.",
    "date": "2024-08-15",
    "rating": 4.62,
    "reviewer_name": "Demo User 1",
    "reviewer_title": "Manager",
    "company_size": "51-200 employees",
    "source": "g2",
    "verified": true
  }
]
```

### Trustpilot Review Sample
```json
[
  {
    "title": "Great Microsoft Products",
    "description": "We've been using Microsoft products for years. Their cloud services are excellent and support is responsive.",
    "date": "2024-01-15",
    "rating": 4.5,
    "reviewer_name": "John Smith",
    "reviewer_title": "IT Director",
    "company_size": "201-500 employees",
    "source": "Trustpilot",
    "verified": true
  }
]
```

## Alternative Source (Bonus Feature)

### Trustpilot Integration

As a bonus feature, this scraper includes support for Trustpilot reviews. To use Trustpilot as a source:

1. Use the `--source trustpilot` parameter
2. The scraper will:
   - Search for the company on Trustpilot
   - Extract reviews within the specified date range
   - Include verification status and ratings
   - Follow the same output format as G2 reviews

Example:
```bash
python review_scraper.py \
  --company "Microsoft" \
  --start-date "2024-01-01" \
  --end-date "2024-12-31" \
  --source "trustpilot" \
  --output "microsoft_trustpilot.json"
```

## Anti-Bot Protection

The scraper implements several measures to avoid detection:
- Random delays between requests (2-10 seconds)
- Modern browser-like headers including:
  - Up-to-date User-Agent strings
  - Proper Accept headers
  - Sec-Fetch headers
- Cookie handling and management
- Referrer chain simulation
- SSL verification with fallback
- Automatic retry with exponential backoff
- Random query parameter addition

## Limitations

- Some websites may block automated access
- Rate limiting may affect scraping speed
- Review content might be truncated on some platforms
- Historical data might be limited
